# Internet-Through-Chat
Internet Through Chat allows clients to access the internet as well as terminals through anything, from IRC to signal to twitter. Anyway text can be placed, a bot can use it as input. 
This is software currently under development. It allows users to access different parts of the internet by things as basic as IRC or as advanced as high top tier chat systems. If a bot can access what you're saying, it can receive it as input.

If you would like to contribute, feel free. This is open source after all.


So how does it work. Well the way that an irc bot works is you tell it some basic intructions, in this case, listen to what the user says, if the user(s) says "!google_search why is the sky blue?" it will then do a google search to find the most appropriate answer.
Same method applies to things like the terminal, if you need to access a vps for example, or even a malicous site, you have a bot do all the work and get all the nasty gunk you would've had to deal with. This means that the vps, could be accessed by you through something like IRC or twitter even.

So how does this even work? VPS through a chatroom?
This sounds crazy but it really is possible, remember, the bot simply just does a task depending on what you say or any given variable. What says a robot can't type in "ls" into a terminal? That's the idea behind this, as well as the whole "going on the internet without going on the internet" idea.

Putting the bot into action:

Now keep in mind, this hasn't been built yet (at the time of writing this 11/15/17)
This is the setting, bot and you are in a chatroom, doesn't matter how you got there, point is, the bot and you don't really know each other. You type in some text, specifically, ls, the bot sees this, and types in "ls", just as you did. The whole (or part) terminal is copied (remember it's just text) then sent out to you. Congrats! You have now made contact with a terminal without even connecting to the bloody thing! There will be more to come (like actual code, derp) so stay tuned.
