# Internet-Through-Chat
Internet Through Chat allows clients to access the internet as well as terminals through anything, from IRC to signal to twitter. Anyway text can be placed, a bot can use it as input. 
This is software currently under development. It allows users to access different parts of the internet by things as basic as IRC or as advanced as high top tier chat systems. If a bot can access what you're saying, it can receive it as input.

If you would like to contribute, feel free. This is open source after all.
